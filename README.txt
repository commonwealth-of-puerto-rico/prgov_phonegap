This is the first PR.gov mobile application
built using Phonegap. Since 2015, it's been available
on the Apple App Store and Google Play under the name
'PRGOV App'.

The application was conceptualized by Andrés Colón 
(github.com/mindware) for the Office of the CIO of
Puerto Rico. The application was primarily developed 
by the talented programmer, Frank Nuñez, who got 
got involved for civic engagement.

The application allows citizens to validate 
government QR-codes safely. Essentially, it validates
if the URL in the QR-code is a proper 'pr.gov' or 
'gobierno.pr' domain and if the information is
offered securedly (via HTTPS), allowing the user to 
visit the site or blocking and warning if any of previous
criteria is not met.
